When we play a song in Spotify we see the distorted backgroud.

I am trying to make the distorted canvas 

use automatic folder => overlay.png by replacing your image

in manual you need to go through 3 steps
1st make the hashtable and get highest occurance of colour reshuffle first 10 and choose any one from them

2nd make the linear-gradient picture from highest colour to black colour

3rd add the ablum cover over the lineargradient image

I am trying to make the 90's effect over it
